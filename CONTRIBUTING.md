Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Emotional Forests Model! This is an open-source conceptual framework, and we welcome contributions that help refine, validate, and expand upon the core idea.

Suggesting New Features: Propose new data points (Branches or Weather/Soil) that could be added to the model.

Refining the Framework: Offer suggestions to improve the theoretical model, the validation plan, or the mitigation strategies.

Identifying Potential Datasets: If you are aware of publicly available clinical trial datasets that would be suitable for a retrospective validation study, please share them.

Expanding the Vision: Propose new applications or future directions for the model.
